# A list of microgrant programs for your good ideas.

I gave away [$5,000 on the Internet](http://heliumgrant.org). It was fun. I'll do it again next year.

I wish I could fund more projects, but I'm not that rich. So, here are some other microgrant programs I learned about that also fund good ideas:

## 5x5 Night
http://5x5night.com/ <br>
_5x5 Night takes place once a month. The community votes on the ideas that will be presented at the event. The selected creators explain a $5,000 step that will move the idea forward, and will meet people who can help._

## Abe's $100 Micro Grant
https://www.mechaelephant.com//microgrant
_A monthly $100 grant to create CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA or GPL (compatible) art, code, hardware designs, etc._

## Awesome Foundation
http://www.awesomefoundation.org/ <br>
_The Awesome Foundation is a global community advancing the interest of awesome in the universe, $1000 at a time. Each fully autonomous chapter supports awesome projects through micro-grants, usually given out monthly._

## Indie Fund

_Indie Fund aims to support the growth of games as a medium by helping indie developers get financially independent and stay financially independent._

## Opportunity Fund
